# Feed-Forward-Nural-Network
# PROBLEM 
In this assignment you need to implement the Feedforward ANN. <br />
You should be able to create a feedforward ANN (FFANN) for any data set.<br />

# Structure: 
Input Layer: Number of perceptrons depend on the data set. <br />
Hidden Layer: 16 perceptrons Output Layer: <br />
Number of perceptrons depend on the data set.  <br /><br />

The weight vectors should be dynamically created and randomly initialized. <br />
The dimensions of the weight vectors depending on the number of nodes in each layer. <br />
You will test your FFANN on the iris data set and MNIST digit data set. <br />
Calculate the cost of each data set using the mean squared error. The Â½ factor that was introduced as a convenience for the squared error discussed in class, is not needed for mean squared error. <br /><br />

Document your result and submit. You only need to implement the feedforward part of ANN and not the backpropagation algorithm.
